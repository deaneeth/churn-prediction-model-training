# 🚀 Customer Churn Prediction – Model Training & Evaluation Pipeline

Welcome to the **model training and evaluation** phase of the **Customer Churn Prediction** project! This repo follows the data preprocessing pipeline from [**Customer Churn Prediction – EDA & Data Preprocessing Pipeline**](https://github.com/deaneeth/churn-prediction-data-pipeline), where we prepared the data for churn modeling. Here, we focus on training machine learning models, evaluating their performance, and saving the trained models for future use.


🚀 **This repo is updated weekly** with:
- Clean, progressive Jupyter notebooks
- Raw & processed datasets
- Practical steps using Python, pandas and scikit-learn
- Real-world-style applied model Training & Evaluation for a customer churn analysis
